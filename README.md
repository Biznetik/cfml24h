# Note #

The only real observation I'll make is the chapters here are very much just intended to be the draft notes for the text content. I'm not fussed about formatting or more "touchy feeling" elements yet.

That'll come once I start the first round of editing. Whenever that might be.

So if you want to mess with the formatting, that's *fine*, but perhaps a bit pointless as it won't be the final formatting anyhow.

What I'm *really* after is technical editing:
* is what I say accurate
* is what I say understandable
* is what I say the right way to go about saying it

Cheers for any help!
